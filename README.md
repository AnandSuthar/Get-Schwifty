# WWDC scholarship 2017

To apply for a scholarship for Apples World Wide Developers Conference 2017 in San Jose we got the task to create a visually interactive Playground. Since building games in Sprite-/SceneKit is not (yet) my biggest strength I decided to do something more creative. Until now I'm not sure if this idea is totally stupid or absolutly genius. Any way, the outcome is awesome and I would love to continue working on the project.

I created actually a Playground in the Playground. In this repository is just the Xcode project for an iOS app but the same also runs in a playground. I built a lexer, parser, AST and generator for a subset of Swift to be able to run Swift code right from my device. I also generate attributed strings to get mostly the same coloring as in Xcode.

Here is a gif of the current state:
